;;;               Enables using the LETF interface when running models on MM
;;;               mm.lisp acts as the mediator, abstracting away all of the MM details from the modeler
;;;               This allows models that have been interfaced with LETF to be portable (run on both HPCs and MM without altering)

FIXME: we need to decide on how to implement the output files.
current implementation: Each run of the model has a stdout/stderr, but those
streams are discarded if the model run is successfull. If the run is unsuccessfull, then the
concatenated stdout/stderr from the model is printed to letf's stderr stream
letf's own stdout/stderr streams are piped to mm_stdout.txt & mm_stderr.txt

these files are the only log/output files sent back to the server. This means that for every successfull run,
the model's stderr and stdout is not saved. Some modelers might want this output. If they do, how do we want to 
implement providing that output to them. But we shouldn't give it for everyone. If the modeler is running a million
runs, and each stdout/stderr is concatenated to a single output file, that file will be (at least) gigs in size.

here's a thought:
mm_stdout.txt & mm_stderr.txt stay the same; they keep track of letf's logs to stdout/stderr, and in the case that the
lisp process crashes, these files will have the last dying comments, so they'll be useful then
so we upload these files to the server (as before), but only append their data to mm_stdout.txt & mm_stderr.txt in the jobs 
directory if they came from a lisp process that crashed. Otherwise, discard their output. This keeps mm_stdout.txt & mm_stderr.txt
in the jobs dir with stdout/stderr data from only crashed model runs (crashed lisp processes)

we then have two additional output files when the modeler wants stdout/stderr from every model run. Call these mm_model_stdout.txt & mm_model_stderr.txt
these will have the model's stdout/stderr from each run. 

so, five output files total:
[1]: mm_out.txt -> IVs & DVs for each run of IVs in the workfile
[2]: mm_stdout.txt -> lisp process's stdout
[3]: mm_stderr.txt -> lisp process's stderr
if desired:
[4]: mm_model_stdout.txt -> model's stdout
[5]: mm_model_stderr.txt -> model's stderr

The default will be to generate 1,2, and 3. And 4 & 5 will only be generated when the modeler really wants them. 

Now, files 2-4 in the jobs directory will be concatenated versions of all 2-4's that were run on volunteers. 
So we need a way to annotate what IVs are associated with each section in the files.
I say we just add the IV vector string that is associated with each section before starting to print the section.

So, if we have this work file:
1 1 1
1 1 2
1 1 3
1 1 4

for 2 and 3, we print
1 1 1
1 1 2
1 1 3
1 1 4
at the beginning of the file. We print all 4 runs b/c this is the lisp process's stdout/stderr, which is associated
with running the entire work file, so all of the lines in the work file. 
So, for these files, we just print the text in the work file at the beginning of the files.

for 4 and 4, we print
1 1 1
before launching the model for those IVs,
1 1 2
before launching the model for those IVs, etc.
