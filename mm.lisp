;;; Description : MindModeling extensions to letf.lisp (lisp-based exploratory testing framework)
;;;               Enables using the LETF interface when running models on MM
;;;               mm.lisp acts as the mediator, abstracting away all of the MM details from the modeler
;;;               This allows models that have been interfaced with LETF to be portable (run on both HPCs and MM without altering)
