In order to interface a non-lisp model, you must [1] launch your model from the command line, [2] accept model inputs on standard input (stdin), and [3] print model outputs to standard output (stdout).

For example, suppose you have a model that has two independent variables (IVs) and two dependent variables (DVs). First, generate a 'work file' that has a row for each set of independent variables that you want to run. Each row should be in JSON IV-name IV-val format:

For this example:
$ cat workfile.txt 
{"IV1":1,"IV2":1}
{"IV1":2,"IV2":1}
{"IV1":3,"IV2":1}
{"IV1":4,"IV2":1}
{"IV1":5,"IV2":2}
{"IV1":6,"IV2":3}
{"IV1":7,"IV2":2}


This workfile says that you want to run a model with two IVs through a set of 7 different IV runs. 

Next, configure your model. It needs to accept IV values on standard input, execute the model for each IV set, and for each IV set, output the dependent variable values to stdout.

Before DVs for each run are printed, a trial start marker needs to be printed to stdout in the form: "IVs=[line received on stdin]\n". This help the wrapper ensure that the outputted DVs are associated with the correct IVs

Each DV outputted should be printed to stdout in the form: "[DVName]=[DVVAL]\n". That is, the name of the DV, and equal sign, the DV's value, and then a newline character.

For this example, here's a python model (model.py):

//////////////////

#!/usr/bin/python

#parameter names below must be capitalized/spelled the same way as in the workfile
def runModel(IV1,IV2):
        DV1 = IV1 * IV1 + IV2 * IV2
        DV2 = IV1 + IV2
        print "DV1" + "=" + str(DV1)
        print "DV2" + "=" + str(DV2)

if __name__=='__main__':
        from sys import stdin; from json import loads
        for line in stdin: 
		print "IVs=" + line.strip() #Used to tell the wrapper that this trial is starting
		runModel(**loads(line))


//////////////////

To execute the model, launch the model from the command line, and get standard input from the workfile, like this:

Python model:
$ python model.py < workfile.txt 
IVs={"IV1":1,"IV2":1}
DV1=2
DV2=2
IVs={"IV1":2,"IV2":1}
DV1=5
DV2=3
IVs={"IV1":3,"IV2":1}
DV1=10
DV2=4
IVs={"IV1":4,"IV2":1}
DV1=17
DV2=5
IVs={"IV1":5,"IV2":2}
DV1=29
DV2=7
IVs={"IV1":6,"IV2":3}
DV1=45
DV2=9
IVs={"IV1":7,"IV2":2}
DV1=53
DV2=9
